- In this project I used:
  1. Ultralytics and YOLOv11 to detect objects in images and videos.
  2. Fine tune and train a YOLO on a custom dataset.
  3. KMeans to cluster pixles and segment players from the background to get the t-shirt color accurately. 
  4. Optical flow to measure the camera movement. 
  5. OpenCV perspective transformation to represent the scene's depth and perspective. 
  6. Measured player's speed and distance covered in the image.
